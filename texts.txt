The purpose of our lives is to be happy.
Life is what happens when youâ€™re busy making other plans.
Get busy living or get busy dying.
You only live once, but if you do it right, once is enough.
If you want to live a happy life, tie it to a goal, not to people or things.
Never let the fear of striking out keep you from playing the game.
Money and success dont change people; they merely amplify what is already there.
Not how long, but how well you have lived is the main thing.
If life were predictable it would cease to be life, and be without flavor.
The whole secret of a successful life is to find out what is ones destiny to do, and then do it.
In order to write about life first you must live it.
The big lesson in life, baby, is never be scared of anyone or anything.
